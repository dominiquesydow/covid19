    "> To contribute to the global effort to combat COVID-19, Diamond has been able to solve a new structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) at high resolution (PDB ID: 6YB7), and complete a large XChem crystallographic fragment screen against it (detailed below). Data have been deposited with the PDB, but we are making the results available immediately to the world on this page; additional work is ongoing, and updates will be continually posted here in coming days and weeks.\n",
